- Different method of displaying information about selected item?
- Add drop all/drop one buttons
- Center all text in right column
- "quick access" button (chose in settings) next to inventory drop-down
- new game button (possibly next to compass?)
- adjust number of NPCs to not be so linear
- investigate no staff creation?
